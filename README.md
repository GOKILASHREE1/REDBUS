# REDBUS PROJECT
# Project Description
# Overview:
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive bus data management and analysis system. The system integrates web scraping, data processing, database management, and an interactive user interface to provide detailed insights and filtering capabilities for bus transportation data.

# Key Components:

# Web Scraping with Selenium:

Objective: Collect data from the Redbus website.
Methodology: Utilized Selenium to automate the web browsing and data extraction process.
Data Extracted: Information such as bus operators, routes, timings, prices, and bus types.

# Data Processing:

Merging Data: Consolidated the scraped data based on transport names and route names.
Data Cleaning: Ensured the data was free from duplicates and inconsistencies, making it suitable for analysis.

# Database Management with MySQL and XAMPP:

Database Setup: Configured a MySQL database using XAMPP to store the cleaned and processed data.
Data Export: Exported the consolidated data into the MySQL database.
Query Writing: Developed SQL queries to efficiently retrieve and manipulate the data for various analytical purposes.

# Interactive User Interface with Streamlit:

Objective: Provide users with a convenient and interactive way to explore and filter bus data.

# Features:
Bus Filters: Users can filter buses based on various criteria such as transport name, route, timing, and price.
Data Display: The filtered data is displayed in a structured dataframe format.
User Experience: Designed the interface to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for users exploring bus data.
# Outcome:
The project delivers a robust system for managing and analyzing bus transportation data. By leveraging web scraping, data processing, and interactive visualization, users can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on real-time data.

# Technologies Used:
Web Scraping: Selenium
Data Processing: Python (Pandas)
Database Management: MySQL, XAMPP
User Interface: Streamlit
